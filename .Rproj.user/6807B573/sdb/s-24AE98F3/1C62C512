The zip archive is deleted after decompression.\n\nBoth train and test data sets are read into R and merged into one table. At this point the table contains subject IDs, activity IDs and a set of 561 numeric features.\n\nFeature descriptions are pulled from the `features.txt` file and only features which inlcude `\"mean()\"` or `\"std()\"` in their description are retained. Such descriptions are set as column names.\n\nNumeric activity IDs are removed in favor of descriptive activity identifiers (ex. WALKING) fetched from the `activity_labels.txt` file. At this point a tidy data set is saved to `tidy-dataset.txt`.\n\nAn independent data set with the average of each feature for each activity and each subject is computed and saved to `tidy-dataset-avg.txt`. \n\n[1]: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones \"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set\"\n",
